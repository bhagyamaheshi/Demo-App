Three quarter of the women have a diversity score between 3 and 4 and none consumes more than 7 food groups over a day. This suggests a fairly low diversity of the diet. The five most frequently consumed food groups were, in order, 'all starchy staples', 'other vegetables', 'dark green leafy vegetables', 'flesh foods' and 'beans and peas'. The frequency of consumption of 'Nuts and seeds', 'eggs' and 'all dairy', three key sources of protein, was particularly low."

The estimated level of consumption usually considered for African countries is 5.1 g/day, based on GEMS regional diets which are derived from national availability (Food Balance Sheets). The observed level of consumption from the Harvest plus surveys suggests a significantly higher level of consumption (up to 107 and 142 g/day at the 95th percentile of consumers only in children and women respectively). Potential high dietary exposure to aflatoxins through groundnuts can be calculated based on the observed high level of consumption per kg body weight; it reaches 7.7 g/kg bw/day and 3.0 g/kg bw/day in children and women respectively at the 95th percentile in consumers only."
